Recent projects involve infocom style zil and zilf compiled to .z
For the compiler we wrote see ~/zorkie
The .z can then be compiled to javascript see ~/z2js (in progress).
The above projects have documentation on the formats of .z files V1-V8.
I will need to play thru a bunch of games to debug.
Make a z2pdf debugging tool. It should print useful info from
the .z file.  I think all .z games have rooms (or maybe called locations)
and the player  can move around with direction commands north, east etc.
See if it is possible to draw map with a box with the name of each room.
Lines should connect each room to the rooms a user can move to labeled
with the direction.
The bigger games will take multiple pages to print.  If a line goes off thec
current page it can be labeled with the name of the room it goes to.

Also print all the input vocabulary.
Also print names of the takable objects (things to pick up).
